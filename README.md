> Check a URL for security headers

shcheck examines the HTTP response headers and source code for a variety of security headers. Basically a command line version of [https://securityheaders.io](https://securityheaders.io/) with a few bonus features.

## Install
### Option 1: Binary

Download the latest release from [https://github.com/jakewarren/shcheck/releases](https://github.com/jakewarren/shcheck/releases)

### Option 2: From source

```
go get github.com/jakewarren/shcheck
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/jakewarren/shcheck
go run bootstrap.go
```

This will download the code into your GOPATH, and then run the bootstrap script to build mage with version infomation embedded in it. A normal `go get` (without -d) will build the binary correctly, but no version info will be embedded. If you've done this, no worries, just go to $GOPATH/src/github.com/jakewarren/shcheck and run `mage install` or `go run bootstrap.go` and a new binary will be created with the correct version information.

The shcheck binary will be created in your $GOPATH/bin directory.

## Usage
